# seagate-blackarmor-nas

Technical data (reverse engineered) and an alternative Linux firmware (Debian 5 Lenny) for the Seagate Blackarmor NAS.

Debian 5 Lenny has reached end of life and should not be used in production anymore. Moritz Rosenthal has released detailed docs on how to update the system with an up-to-date linux kernel and Debian distribution. Make sure to check out [his wiki page](http://wiki.ccc-ffm.de/projekte:diverses:seagate_blackarmor_nas_220_debian) for further information.
