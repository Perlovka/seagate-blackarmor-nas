# seagate-blackarmor-nas

Technical data (reverse engineered) and an alternative firmware (Debian Lenny) for the Seagate Blackarmor NAS.

Debian Lenny has reached end of life and should not be used in production anymore. Moritz Rosenthal has released detailed docs on how to update the system with an up-to-date linux kernel and Debian distribution. Make sure to check out [his wiki page](http://wiki.ccc-ffm.de/projekte:diverses:seagate_blackarmor_nas_220_debian) for further information.
